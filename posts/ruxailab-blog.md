## What is RUXAILAB?

**RUXAILAB** (Remote Usability Experience Lab) is an open source initiative focused on advancing human-computer interaction through modern web technologies. From eye tracking and sentiment analysis to accessibility audits and user testing pipelines, our mission is to make advanced UX tools accessible to everyone.

## Why a Blog?

This blog will serve several goals:

- ðŸ’¡ Share technical tutorials, design patterns, and performance tips related to **Vue.js**, **VitePress**, and our open source tools.
- ðŸ“¢ Announce new features, releases, and projects from the lab.
- ðŸ§ª Report on user research, field tests, and collaborative experiments with universities and organizations.
- ðŸ’¬ Spark conversations with the wider Vue and open source community.

## Open Source by Default

Everything we build is **open source-first**. Our components, test pipelines, and analytics tools are designed to work with the Vue ecosystem and beyond.

Stay tuned for upcoming posts on:
- Integrating **eye tracking** into Vue-based apps
- Performing **remote usability tests** using VitePress
- How we use **telemetry and sentiment analysis** to improve accessibility
