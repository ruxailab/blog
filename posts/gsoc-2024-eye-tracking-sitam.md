## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to **improve eye-tracking algorithms** by exploring new techniques, optimizing existing parameters, and integrating JavaScript solutions to make eye-tracking technology more accessible through low-resolution cameras.

## The Challenge

Traditional eye-tracking systems often require expensive, high-resolution cameras and specialized hardware, creating barriers for researchers and developers who want to implement eye-tracking in their applications. Our mission was to democratize this technology by making it work effectively with standard, low-resolution cameras.

## What We Accomplished

### üîç Algorithm Optimization
- Implemented advanced computer vision techniques to enhance tracking accuracy
- Optimized existing algorithms to work efficiently with low-resolution input
- Developed robust calibration methods for various camera setups

### üöÄ JavaScript Integration
- Created web-based eye-tracking solutions that run directly in browsers
- Implemented real-time processing capabilities for immediate feedback
- Ensured cross-platform compatibility for maximum accessibility

### üìä Performance Improvements
- Significantly reduced computational requirements
- Improved tracking stability under various lighting conditions
- Enhanced accuracy even with budget hardware setups

## Technical Approach

The project involved:

1. **Computer Vision Optimization**: Enhancing existing algorithms to extract maximum information from low-resolution images
2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Implementing ML models to improve tracking prediction and accuracy
3. **Real-time Processing**: Optimizing performance for live eye-tracking applications
4. **Web Technology Integration**: Making the solution accessible through modern web browsers

## Impact and Applications

This work opens up eye-tracking technology to:
- **Educational researchers** studying learning patterns
- **UX designers** analyzing user interaction patterns
- **Accessibility developers** creating assistive technologies
- **Game developers** implementing gaze-based controls

## Mentorship Experience

Working with mentors [Marc Gonzalez Capdevila](https://github.com/marcgc21), [Karine Pistili Rodrigues](https://github.com/), and [Vin√≠cius Cavalcanti](https://github.com/) was an incredible learning experience. Their guidance helped me navigate complex technical challenges and understand the broader impact of accessible technology.

## Code and Contributions

Check out the implementation and improvements in our [web-eye-tracker repository](https://github.com/ruxailab/web-eye-tracker/pull/26). The codebase now includes:
- Enhanced tracking algorithms
- Improved calibration processes
- Better performance optimization
- Comprehensive documentation

## Looking Forward

This project represents a significant step toward making eye-tracking technology accessible to everyone. The optimizations and techniques developed here will continue to benefit the RUXAILAB ecosystem and the broader open-source community.
