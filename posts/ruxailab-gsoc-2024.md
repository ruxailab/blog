## About Our GSoC 2024 Journey

Being accepted into Google Summer of Code was a dream come true for our organization. As "The User Experience LAB based on IA," we had the incredible opportunity to mentor three talented contributors who worked on groundbreaking projects that advanced our mission of democratizing usability and accessibility evaluation through Artificial Intelligence.

## Our Successful Projects

### 1. Eye Tracking Algorithm Optimization Based on Low-Resolution Cameras
**Contributor:** [Sitam Meur](https://github.com/sitammeur)  
**Mentors:** Marc Gonzalez Capdevila, Karine Pistili Rodrigues, Vin√≠cius Cavalcanti

This project focused on improving eye-tracking algorithms by exploring new techniques, optimizing existing parameters, and integrating JavaScript solutions. The work significantly enhanced our [web-eye-tracker](https://github.com/ruxailab/web-eye-tracker/pull/26) capabilities, making eye-tracking technology more accessible through low-resolution cameras.

### 2. Implementation of Card Sorting Method on RUXAILAB
**Contributor:** [Julio Manoel](https://github.com/JulioManoel)  
**Mentors:** Marc Gonzalez Capdevila, Karine Pistili Rodrigues

This project introduced a new user evaluation method using card sorting, seamlessly integrated into the RUXAILAB environment. The implementation expanded our suite of [UX evaluation tools](https://github.com/ruxailab/RUXAILAB/pull/534), providing researchers with another powerful method for understanding user mental models.

### 3. Data Extraction for Sentiment Analysis from Usability Tests
**Contributor:** [Basma Elhoseny](https://github.com/BasmaElhoseny01)  
**Mentors:** Karine Pistili Rodrigues, Vin√≠cius Cavalcanti

A standalone backend solution that leverages sentiment analysis to streamline the evaluation process for moderated usability tests. This [sentiment analysis API](https://github.com/ruxailab/sentiment-analysis-api) enables researchers to automatically extract emotional insights from user testing sessions.

## Our Mission and Impact

RUXAILAB is dedicated to **democratizing usability and accessibility evaluation** through AI-powered tools. We provide a comprehensive suite of solutions that enable remote usability and accessibility testing, including:

- üß™ **User Testing** methodologies
- üìù **Heuristic Evaluation** frameworks  
- üëÅÔ∏è **Eye-Tracking systems**
- ü§ñ **Sentiment Analysis** tools
- ü•Ω **VR prototyping** utilities (2D to VR conversion)
- üî• **Heatmap analysis** for advanced data extraction

## Breaking Down Barriers

Our mission is to **eliminate financial and technological barriers** to usability and accessibility research. We believe that anyone, anywhere, should be able to set up their own usability lab at **zero cost**. GSoC 2024 helped us take significant steps toward this goal.

## Technologies We Work With

Our projects span multiple technologies including:
- **Python** for backend AI algorithms
- **JavaScript** for web-based tools
- **HTML/CSS** for user interfaces
- **Firebase** for cloud infrastructure

## Looking Forward

The success of our first GSoC experience has energized our team and community. We're grateful to Google, our amazing contributors (Sitam, Julio, and Basma), and our dedicated mentors who made this possible.

We invite **developers, designers, and researchers** to join us in expanding our toolkit, refining existing solutions, and fostering a more accessible digital world.
